# Specification Quality Checklist: Power BI Best Practices Analyzer & AI Auto-Fix Web App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Reasonable defaults were applied for: authentication (standard OAuth2/credential flow), browser support (modern browsers), responsive breakpoints (1024px minimum), best practices rule set (community-recognized BPA rules).
- All assumptions are documented in the Assumptions section of the spec.
